=======
workenv
=======

A bash shortcut for jumping between local work environments and carrying out tasks
within them.

Requires Python 3.7+ and bash.


Quick example
=============

Example ``~/.workenv_config.yml``::

    myproject:
      path: /path/to/myproject
      source: venv/bin/activate
      run:
      - nvm use
      commands:
        database:
          run: docker-compose up database

Example usage::

    # Jump to /path/to/myproject with the local python virtual environment and nvm
    we myproject

    # Jump to /path/to/myproject and run the database container
    we myproject database

    # Bash completion support
    we m<tab> d<tab>

There is also support for a ``_common`` project with values applied to all projects -
see docs below.


Installation
============

Install to a virtual environment with::

  cd path/to/installation
  virtualenv --python=python3.8 venv
  . venv/bin/activate
  pip install workenv
  workenv --install

This will add the command as ``we`` by adding a line to your ``.bashrc``.

If you would prefer a different command name, you can specify it when installing::

  workenv --install workon

Restart your shell session for your change to take effect.

To uninstall, remove the line from ``.bashrc`` and delete your virtual environment.


Configuration
=============

Add the current path as a new project::

    we --add projectname

Add the current path as a new command::

    we --add projectname command

Open your ``.workenv_config.yml`` for customisation::

    we --edit


Configuration file format
-------------------------

The top level of the YAML file are the names of the projects.

A project can have the following attributes:

``path``
  The path to set as the current working directory. This will be the first command run.

  Example::

      path: /path/to/foo

  Bash equivalent::

      cd /path/to/foo


``source``
  Path or paths to call using ``source``

  Example::

      source:
      - venv/bin/activate
      - .env

  Bash equivalent::

      source venv/bin/activate
      source .env


``env``
  Dict of environment variables to set

  Example::

      env:
        COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME: my_project

  Bash equivalent::

      export COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=my_project


``run``
  Command or list of commands to run

  Example::

      run:
      - nvm use
      - yvm use

  Bash equivalent::

      nvm use
      yvm use


``commands``
  Dict of Command objects

  Example::

    myproject:
      commands:
        database:
          run: docker-compose up database

  Usage::

      we myproject database

  Bash equivalent::

      docker-compose up database

  A command will inherit the ``path`` and ``env`` of its parent project, unless it
  defines its own.

  It will inherit the ``source`` of its parent project only if it does not specify its
  own path or source.

  A command can have the same attributes as a project, except it cannot define its own
  ``commands``.

Values can substitute the project name with ``{{project.name}}``.

There are two special top-level YAML objects:

``_config``
  Controls settings:

  ``verbose``
    If ``true``, show bash commands when running them

  ``history``
    If ``true``, add the commands to history

``_common``
  Common project which can define a common ``source``, ``env``, ``run`` and ``commands``
  which will be added to all other projects, regardless of whether they define their
  own.

  The common project cannot specify a path.


Full example
============

Putting together all the options above into a sample ``.workenv_config.yml``::

    _config:
      verbose: true
      history: false
    _common:
      env:
        COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME: '{{project.name}}'
      commands:
        open:
          run: xdg-open .
    myproject:
      path: /path/to/myproject
      source:
      - venv/bin/activate
      - .env
      run:
      - ./manage.py migrate
      - ./manage.py runserver 0:8000
      commands:
        database:
          run: docker-compose up database
    other:
      path: /path/to/other


``we myproject`` is equivalent to typing::

    cd /path/to/myproject
    source venv/bin/activate
    source .env
    export COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=myproject
    ./manage.py migrate
    ./manage.py runserver 0:8000

``we myproject database`` is equivalent to typing::

    cd /path/to/myproject
    source venv/bin/activate
    source .env
    export COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=myproject
    docker-compose up database

``we other`` is equivalent to typing::

    cd /path/to/other
    export COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=other

``we other open`` is equivalent to::

    cd /path/to/myproject
    export COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=other
    xdg-open .
